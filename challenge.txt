Our tour team needs a report created that show how many boxes of peaches and how many bags of pecans we have sold on each of our tours. Here is some context you’ll need:

- We are running three tours this year – South, Midwest and North East
- Each tour is made up of two routes
- Each route is comprised of stops which take place at locations
- We sell three products on tour:
	- Single Tour Box (peaches)
	- Single bag of pecans
	- The Special (two bags of pecans, and two boxes of peaches)

The operations team needs to know:
- How many boxes of peaches and bags of pecans to order from the farm for each day of the tour
- How many boxes and bags need to go to each tour (South, Midwest, and North East)
- How many boxes and bags need to go to each location

Can you create a report that shows the above information for all Tours in 2021 and make it easy for the operations team to find the information they are looking for?

Let me know if you have any questions.
